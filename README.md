# Basic-Triangle-Calculator
Basic triangle calculator that can calculate side lengths, perimeter, and area
Repl.it repository : https://repl.it/@CyanandDani/Basic-Triangle-Calculator

## Get Started
### Run online
Just go to the link to use the program!
1. Go to https://basic-triangle-calculator.cyananddani.repl.run/
2. Follow Usage section below
### Run locally
Prerequisites : Python3 installation with standard library (math lib)
1. Clone repository
2. Run "main.py" using Python

## Usage
When the program starts up it gives you a welcome message:
> Basic triangle calculator by Minedani129
> Global options currently available: ...

The second line tells you the global options that you can change.
The next line printed out will be:
> Enter any global options. Else just leave empty and press enter:

You can type in any options/arguments that can change program functionality. All the options are listed in the "Global options available" line above. It tells you the option name and what to input. For example, one option is --ROUND \{int}. "--ROUND" is the option name that you type in, and the \{int} part tells you to input an integer.
The --ROUND option lets you specify how many decimal places you want to round to.
If you do not want to change any options you can just press enter without typing anything.

After all that it tells you to enter hypotenuse length, leg1 length, and leg2 length. If you do not know a value (for example to find missing side) you can leave it blank and press enter. The program will automatically find the side length.
The program will also output the perimeter and area.

## Options / arguments
* --ROUND \{int} - Round output to \{int} number of decimal places

Note: If you come across any calculation errors or bugs please make an issue on Github cuz my math and coding is bad. Also make a feature request if u want.
